# EURO 2024 betting script
## Description
This is a script for automatic counting of points for betting on matches. This is made for me and colleagues to use. 

## How does it work? 
Betting participants place bets on matches via Google forms. The script collects data from responses to the Google forms survey, which also contains correct match results after matches. Then it counts the points and creates a new sheet containing a table with points and separate sheets for each participant presenting the points received for each match and the results bet.
